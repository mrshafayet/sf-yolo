## Our conference version: XXXX 2024 "Efficient Small Object Detection in Aerial Images:A Lightweight and Precise Approach" at: [XXXX Open Access](https://openaccess.com)

## Abstract

Detecting small objects in complex scenes, particularly aerial images, is a challenging task due to limited feature representation, densely distributed objects, and significant scale variations. Existing methods encounter difficulties in retaining fine-grained features, balancing feature aggregation, and optimizing regression for small objects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that combines the Inverted Residual Mobile Block (iRMB), the Selective Fusion Neck (SF-Neck), and the Focaler-Inner-CIoU loss function. The iRMB module integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for efficient local feature extraction with Transformer-based self-attention for capturing global dependencies, ensuring the preservation and enhancement of small object features. The SF-Neck further refines multi-scale feature fusion, enhancing detection precision in dense and scale-variant scenes. Additionally, the Focaler-Inner-CIoU loss function incorporates adaptive scaling and interval mapping, improving bounding box regression accuracy by dynamically prioritizing low-IoU and high-IoU samples. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted experiments on the DOTA and VisDrone datasets, which present unique challenges such as significant object scale variations, high-density clusters, and diverse object categories. On the VisDrone dataset, the model achieved a 15.3% increase in APS (Average Precision for Small objects) and a 12% reduction in false positives, significantly outperforming the baseline. On the DOTA dataset, the method improved APS by 12.4% and mAP by 9.7%, showcasing its capability to effectively detect small and densely packed objects in aerial imagery. These results demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed method, establishing a new benchmark for small object detection in complex aerial and remote sensing scenarios.
